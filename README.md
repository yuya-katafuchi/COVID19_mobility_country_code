# Overview
This repository provides data giving country codes for mobility data in COVID-19 provided in [ActiveConclusion/COVID19_mobility](https://github.com/ActiveConclusion/COVID19_mobility). The problem with combining this mobility data with other data is that the country names are not all the same (i.e. there are different country names in each data set) and the country codes are not pre-associated with the country names. Data of correspondences between country names and country codes in this repository will be useful in connecting mobility data with other data by country.
